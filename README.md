# Year-project-1

The code will be use for Year-project from 06 

06:Skyboxes with a simple music player using SDL, camera speed is modified using frame time, load a model with texture. J: start playing music, K: pause, L:continue. There is a problem about the music player. After starting the music, it loops only the first seconds of the song. If I press "K" to pause and press "L" to continue, this problem will fixed. I don't know why. Maybe is a bug of the library or I use the library incorrectly.

07:the implement of shadow map(directional light) on the basis of 06.

08:on the basis of shadow map(directional light)， I add background music , using SDL library, without SDL_MIXER library(I'm modifying the  error of loading models)

09:There is something wrong with SDL Mixer library, but it's useful for me to learn how to add the path of library in CMakeLists.text
