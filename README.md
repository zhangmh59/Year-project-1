# Year-project

The code will be use for Year-project from 06 

6-Skyboxes : Skyboxes with a simple music player using SDL, camera speed is modified using frame time, load a model with texture. J: start playing music, K: pause, L:continue. There is a problem about the music player. After starting the music, it loops only the first seconds of the song. If I press "K" to pause and press "L" to continue, this problem will fixed. I don't know why. Maybe is a bug of the library or I use the library incorrectly.


06-Skyboxes_YearP1：

[代码有错误，主要是glad和gegl库冲突，血泪教训，我就该一开始就用老师的库。一开始有问题不问，给自己挖了坑，快deadline了还要改代码。希望下学期的computer graphics可以做好。]

上述错误已解决，正在尝试重写模型加载部分的代码，YearProject/06-Skyboxes_YearP1为原来的代码，模型加载位置有点问题，天空盒和音乐正常。


07:the implement of shadow map(directional light) on the basis of 06.

08:on the basis of shadow map(directional light)， I add background music , using SDL library, without SDL_MIXER library(I'm modifying the  error of loading models)

09:There is something wrong with SDL Mixer library, but it's useful for me to learn how to add the path of library in CMakeLists.text

12：YearProject/06-Skyboxes_YearP1  的备份， 加载模型有一点问题，但是天空盒子正常，正在尝试往里面加碰撞检测所以备份以防万一哈哈哈哈。
